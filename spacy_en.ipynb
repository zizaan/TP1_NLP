Algebra was a unifying theory that allowed rational numbers, irrational numbers, geometric expressions and others to be treated as algebraic objects, and gave mathematics as a whole a new path to development in a much broader concept than what had existed before, and provided a means for development in this subject The future and another important aspect of introducing the ideas of algebra is that it allowed the application of mathematics on itself in a way that had not happened before, and provided a means for development in this subject in the future'","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"doc = nlp(text)\n\ntoken_list = []\nfor token in doc:\n           token_list.append(token.text)\nprint (token_list)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"filtered_sent=[]\n\nfor word in doc:\n           if word.is_stop==False and word.text.isalpha()==True:\n                      filtered_sent.append(word)\nprint(filtered_sent)\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"post_tag=[]\n\nfor post in doc:\n           post_tag.append([post.text,post.pos_])\nprint (post_tag)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lemmas = [[token.text,token.lemma_] for token in doc]\nprint(lemmas)\n\nspacy_stopwords = STOP_WORDS\nprint(spacy_stopwords)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
